This mod generates speech utilizing a number of conditions (such as: moods/events) and randomization to create dynamic dialogue.  


### Contributing:
Feel free to offer advice/suggestions!
#### Some things to keep in mind when writing phrases:
- Keep them short when you can.
- Don't captilize anything other than 'I' or proper nouns.
- Punctuation is fine, but keep in mind all '.' can become '!' - so avoid things like U.S.A. or F.B.I.
- Avoid swears (as there is dynamic swearing built-in).
- For the moment any \*emotive actions\* have to be the entire phrase (which won't be filtered).
- Keywords can be replaced at random using this format: <WORD>.
